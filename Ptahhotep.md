Ptahhotep was an ancient Egyptian wise man who lived about 4,400 years ago (around 2400 BCE). He was the vizier (like the prime minister) for a pharaoh and wrote the oldest complete book of wisdom that still survives: *The Maxims of Ptahhotep*. It’s a father-to-son guide on how to live well, stay out of trouble, and become a successful, respected person. Here are his most important teachings, grouped into clear sections and explained in simple words:

### 1. Stay Calm and Quiet
- Great words come from a cool head; hot heads only make noise.  
  Never shout or rush to speak—silence makes you look stronger and smarter.
- If you control your temper, you control your life.  
  An angry person destroys himself first.

### 2. How to Talk and Listen
- Listen more than you talk.  
  If you really listen (even to someone lower than you), people will say you’re wise.
- Speak only after you’ve thought it through.  
  One good sentence is better than a thousand empty ones.
- Don’t brag or show off.  
  Humble words make you bigger; proud words make you small.

### 3. Be Honest and Fair
- Justice is stronger than any wall.  
  Do the right thing even when no one is watching—it lasts forever.
- Don’t cheat or steal, even a little.  
  Greed is a disease that eats the greedy person first.
- Treat the poor and weak with kindness.  
  A real leader protects people who can’t protect themselves.

### 4. Family and Home Life
- Marry young and train your wife with love and respect.  
  A happy wife makes a happy house.
- Raise your kids with gentle discipline.  
  Teach them by example—if you yell, they’ll yell later.
- If your child listens and obeys, thank the gods. If not, it’s usually the parent’s fault.

### 5. Work and Success
- Do your job perfectly, even small tasks.  
  Excellent work speaks louder than any title.
- Don’t envy rich or powerful people.  
  Their fancy life often hides big problems.
- Be content with what you have.  
  Wanting too much makes you blind to what’s already good.

### 6. Dealing with Friends and Enemies
- Choose friends who are honest and calm.  
  Bad friends drag you down faster than any enemy.
- If someone attacks you with words, don’t fight back the same way.  
  Stay quiet or answer softly—it makes them look foolish.

### 7. Getting Older
- Old age is a gift, not a curse.  
  Respect old people—they’ve seen everything and know what actually matters.
- Teach the young so your wisdom lives after you die.

Ptahhotep’s big message: True success isn’t gold, big houses, or fancy titles. It’s self-control, kind words, honest work, and treating everyone fairly. If you live this way, people will love and respect you while you’re alive—and remember you long after you’re gone.
