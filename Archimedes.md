Archimedes was an ancient Greek genius who figured out tons of ideas about math, machines, and how things float or move. Here are his most famous and important discoveries, grouped into clear sections and explained in simple words:

### 1. Buoyancy (Why Things Float)
- The Buoyancy Principle (the “Eureka!” law)  
  When you put something in water, the water pushes it up with a force equal to the weight of the water it pushes out of the way.  
  That’s why heavy ships float (they push away tons of water) and why a little rock sinks (it only pushes away a tiny bit of water).
- How he discovered it  
  He jumped in a bathtub, saw the water rise, and yelled “Eureka!” (I found it!) because he finally knew how to check if a crown was pure gold without breaking it.

### 2. Levers and Simple Machines
- “Give me a place to stand and a long enough lever, and I can move the world.”  
  A small force on a long lever can lift a huge weight. The farther you push from the pivot point, the easier it is.
- He built giant machines  
  Using levers, pulleys, and compound pulleys, he pulled a huge ship onto the beach all by himself to prove it works.

### 3. The Power of Math in Real Life
- Center of gravity  
  He figured out exactly where an object balances (its center of gravity) and used it to make things stable or tip over on purpose.
- How to measure weird shapes  
  He showed how to find the area and volume of curved things (like spheres, cones, and cylinders) with exact formulas we still use today.

### 4. Amazing Numbers and Big Ideas
- The value of Pi (π)  
  He was the first person to trap Pi between two numbers (he said it’s between 3 10/71 and 3 1/7), way closer than anyone before.
- The Sand Reckoner  
  He invented a way to write super-giant numbers (bigger than grains of sand in the whole universe) just to prove nobody can say “some things are too big to count.”

### 5. War Machines (Defense of Syracuse)
- The Claw of Archimedes  
  A giant crane with a huge grabbing hook that lifted Roman ships out of the water and smashed them.
- Burning mirrors  
  He set up huge polished shields to focus sunlight and set enemy ships on fire from far away (like a giant magnifying glass).
- Super catapults and stone-throwers  
  He made machines that could hurl giant rocks farther and more accurately than anyone thought possible.

### 6. The Method of Mechanical Theorems
- He used imagination tricks with levers and balances to discover math truths.  
  He would pretend a shape was balanced on a giant lever, then use the lever law to figure out its area or volume—almost like using physics to do geometry.

### 7. Screws and Water
- The Archimedes Screw  
  A big spinning screw inside a tube that lifts water uphill. Farmers still use it today in some places to move water from rivers to fields.

Archimedes’ big message: Math isn’t just numbers on paper—it can lift ships, sink armies, measure the stars, and explain why anything floats or falls. If you understand the rules clearly, a single smart person with the right idea can do things that look like magic.
