Niccolo Machiavelli wrote a famous book called *The Prince* about how rulers can get power and keep it. Here are his most important ideas (principles), grouped into clear categories and explained in simple, everyday words:

### 1. How a Ruler Should Be Seen by People
- It is better to be feared than loved (but don’t be hated).  
  If people love you, they might stop supporting you when things get tough. If they fear you a little, they’ll obey even when it’s hard. Just don’t make them hate you, or they’ll try to get rid of you.
- Always look like you have good qualities.  
  Appear merciful, honest, religious, kind, and trustworthy—even if you’re not always those things inside. People judge you by what they see, not what’s really in your heart.
- Keep your word only when it helps you.  
  Promises are useful, but if keeping a promise hurts you later, break it. Just find a good excuse so people don’t think you’re a liar.

### 2. Being Tough vs. Being Nice
- Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind in the long run.  
  One harsh act (like punishing troublemakers fast) can stop bigger problems and save more lives later.
- Act like a lion and a fox.  
  Be strong and scary like a lion, but also sneaky and clever like a fox who escapes traps.
- Destroy enemies completely or make them your friends.  
  Half-measures create future enemies who want revenge. Either wipe them out or win them over totally.

### 3. Luck and Skill
- Fortune (luck) is like a wild river, but you can build dams ahead of time.  
  Bad luck will come, so prepare when things are calm—train your army, make strong plans, and build support.
- Bold moves beat waiting around.  
  Luck likes brave, energetic people more than cautious ones who do nothing.

### 4. Army and War
- Your own army is always better than hired mercenaries.  
  Paid soldiers run away when things get hard. A prince who depends on them will lose power.
- A ruler must think about war even in peacetime.  
  Study battles, train your body and mind, and practice leading every single day.

### 5. How to Treat People and Nobles
- Let other people do the dirty work for you.  
  If you have to punish someone harshly, let a minister or general do it. Then you can punish that person later and look like the good guy.
- Keep powerful nobles weak and the common people happy.  
  Rich lords might try to take your throne. Ordinary people just want safety and not to be bothered. Give them that, and they’ll support you.

### 6. Getting and Keeping Power
- It’s easier to hold power you inherited than power you just conquered.  
  People accept a family that has ruled for a long time. New rulers have to work extra hard and be extra ruthless at first.
- When you conquer a new place, go live there or send colonies.  
  Being close lets you spot problems fast and scare people into obeying.
- Use cruelty all at once, then stop; give benefits slowly over time.  
  Do the scary stuff quickly so people forget it. Hand out rewards bit by bit so people stay grateful.

These are the big lessons Machiavelli wanted rulers to know: power isn’t about being a perfect good person—it’s about doing whatever actually works to stay in charge and keep the country strong.
